My name is Camaron-Foster
My passion is applying machine-learning to Government-Policy-Modeling
and
the creation of Governing-Decentralized-Autonoumous-Organizations over Open-Source-Protocols,
with the goal of faster policy response times, and therefore improved safety; transparency, democratic-processes, 
and so one down the long-tail.

I wake up every morning excited to exploring this space of ideas; if you find this interesting as well, please reach out.

Without Wax,
